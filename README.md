# ReactiveX Resources

For some reason it is quite hard to find a lot of quality resources related to reactive programming. There are a lot of those - they are just hard to find. So here's the list I find most valuable to kick off with reactive programming.

Note: Some of the links are js related and some are c# related but they are explaining core concepts of the rx.

1. Short article explaining the basic of reactive programming (js)
[The introduction to Reactive Programming you've been missing](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754)

2. For some reason the documentation for reactivex is not quite visible. This is probably the best place to learn the core components available in all language implementations.
[Subjects](http://reactivex.io/documentation/subject.html)

3. Best online book with jsbin samples and detailed documentation on api (js, but as I said the api is simular for all languages)
[Introduction to RxJS](http://xgrommx.github.io/rx-book/index.html)

4. Decision tree that will help you get used with the api (have simular in the online book [Introduction to RxJS](http://xgrommx.github.io/rx-book/index.html)
[Decision Tree](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators.html)

5. Interactive marble diagrams - really helpful to visualize what will happen with your observables when applying different functions
[Rx Marble Digrams](http://rxmarbles.com/)

6. One of the good presentation with a lot of sample coding
[Matthew Podwysocki - Streaming and event-based programming using FRP and RxJS (FutureJS 2014)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlERo_JMGCw)

7. RX explained by one of the people behind the idea - explained with pseudo language and math operations and logics
[Expert to Expert: Brian Beckman and Erik Meijer - Inside the .NET Reactive Framework (Rx)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looJcaeboBY)

8. How Neflix use it everywhere (js)
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRYN2xt11Ek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRYN2xt11Ek)

9. Really nice explanaition with examples from MSDN (c#)
[Using RX](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh242981(v=vs.103).aspx)

10. 101 RX samples (js)

11. Video examples (js)

This list will be updated over time.

Note: There are quite a lot of other resources out there - like MS introduction videos and workshops but there are quite outdated(2011 - 2012). And there is a upcoming book [Rx.NET in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rx-dot-net-in-action) that should be released this december.
